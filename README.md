# Insurance
a prediction model for medical insurance premiums is built using Machine Learning techniques
The notebook starts with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the given dataset, followed by preprocessing and cleaning of data. Then, several machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to find the best model for the prediction of insurance premiums. The performance of the final model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics and its performance is compared with other models.

There are 4 models in this notebook , LinearModel , RandomForest , DecisionTree , XgbRegressor 
Also for last 3 models we got  their best Hyperparameters and updated Score Table too.
